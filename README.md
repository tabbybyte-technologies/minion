# Minion ü§ñ

A Bun-based Node.js CLI tool for AI-powered command execution with built-in safety features.

> **Note:** Minion is intended for quick execution of small to medium _ad hoc_ tasks on the command line, not for large or complex projects.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (install with: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
- An API key for your chosen AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Generative AI, or local LLM)

## Features

- üîí **Safe Command Execution**: Built-in allowlist and dangerous command detection
- ü§ñ **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Generative AI, and local LLM endpoints
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First**: Comprehensive safety guardrails
- üöÄ **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Built with Bun for optimal performance
- üì¶ **Modular**: Clean, composable architecture

## Installation

### Global Installation
```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g @tabbybyte/minion

# Using bun
bun install -g @tabbybyte/minion
```

### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tabbybyte-technologies/minion
cd minion

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the tool directly (requires flags or input)
bun run dev -p "List all files in the current directory"

# Optional: Build a single executable binary
bun run build
```

## Configuration

Minion uses environment variables for configuration, which can be set at runtime by placing a `.env` file in the current directory. The required and optional environment variable names are detailed in the `env.SAMPLE` file included in the repository.

```bash
# Required: Choose your AI provider
MINION_PROVIDER=openai  # or anthropic, google, local

# For OpenAI
MINION_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MINION_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview

# For Anthropic
MINION_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MINION_ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229

# For Google Generative AI
MINION_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MINION_GOOGLE_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro-latest

# For Local LLM (OpenAI-compatible API)
MINION_LOCAL_API_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
MINION_LOCAL_API_KEY=local
MINION_LOCAL_MODEL=mistral-medium
```

Refer to `env.SAMPLE` for a complete list of supported environment variables.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# From stdin
echo "List all files in the current directory" | minion

# From file
minion -f task.txt

# Directly from command line
minion -p "List all files in the current directory"

<!-- Dry run mode is temporarily disabled -->
```

### Examples

**File management:**
```bash
echo "Create a new directory called 'projects' and list its contents" | minion
```

**Development tasks:**
```bash
echo "Initialize a new npm project and install express" | minion
```

**System information:**
```bash
echo "Show me system information and current disk usage" | minion
```

**Git operations:**
```bash
echo "Check git status and show the last 3 commits" | minion
```

### Command Line Options

```
Usage: minion [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --prompt <prompt> Specify the prompt directly on the command line
  -f, --file <path>    Read prompt from file instead of stdin
  -h, --help          Show this help message
  --dry-run           (Temporarily disabled)
  --version, -v       Show version information
```

## Safety Features

### Command Allowlist
Only approved commands can be executed:
- File operations: `ls`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, etc.
- Development tools: `git`, `npm`, `bun`, `docker`, etc.
- System utilities: `ps`, `df`, `ping`, etc.

### Dangerous Command Detection
Blocks potentially harmful commands:
- `rm -rf /` (recursive deletion)
- Fork bombs `:(){ :|:& };:`
- Direct device access
- System shutdown commands
- And more...

### Dry Run Mode
**Temporarily Disabled**
The `--dry-run` feature is currently disabled and will not have any effect. It will be re-enabled in a future release.

## Security

This tool is designed with safety as a primary concern, but users should:
- Review commands before execution in production environments
<!-- Dry-run mode is temporarily disabled -->
- Keep API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- Regularly update the tool to get the latest safety improvements
